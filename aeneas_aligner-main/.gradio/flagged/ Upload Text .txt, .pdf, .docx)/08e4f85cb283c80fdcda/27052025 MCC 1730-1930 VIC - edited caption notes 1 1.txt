-:  Good evening, everybody. I declare the meeting open at 5.31 p.m. and I welcome Councillors and Management and members of the public in today's meeting both here and in person and virtually. We are meeting on the Wurundjeri, Woi Wurrung country and I respectfully acknowledge the traditional owners of the land we govern, the Wurundjeri Woi Wurrung and Bunurong Boonwurrung peoples of the Kulin and pay respect to their Elders past and present. We acknowledge and honour the unbroken spiritual, cultural and political connection they have maintained to this unique place for more than 2,000 generations. We accept the invitation in the Uluru Statement from the Heart and are committed to walking together to build a better future. This meeting is being streamed live and the recording will be published on Council's website by close of business tomorrow. The unconfirmed minutes of this meeting will also be available from the City of Melbourne's website as soon as practicable. I request that all mobile phones be turned off or to silent for the duration of the meeting. No apologies have been received. All right. We move on to agenda item 2, disclosure of conflicts of interest. If any Councillor has either a general or material conflict of interest, please disclose that at the time of the relevant agenda item. We move on to agenda item 3, confirmation of minutes of the previous meetings and I call on a Councillor to move a motion adopting the open minutes of Council meeting number 5 held on Tuesday the 29th of April 2025 and unscheduled meeting number 6 held on Tuesday the 13th of May 2025. I'll take Councillor Camillo as a mover and Councillor Liu as a seconder. All those in favour, please raise your hand. I declare that carried unanimously. Thank you. We move on to agenda item 4, matters arising from the minutes of the previous meeting. Are there any matters arising from the minutes of the previous meeting anybody wants to call out?  No. All right. We move on to correspondence and submissions and the following submissions have been received in accordance with the Council's Governance Rules in relation to agenda item 6.1 Greenline Quarterly Report. We have an item of correspondence from Honorary Councillor Chris Thrum. And in relation to agenda item 6.2 Queen Victoria Market Precinct Renewal Program Quarterly Report we have an item of correspondence from Fahna Ammett. All right. I'm now going to check the status of confidential items. Does any Councillor wish to discuss confidential status of any of the confidential items listed in the public agenda?  No. All right. Then in that case we move on to agenda item 5 which is reports from Committee and there are no reports from Committee. We move on to reports from Management and there are four reports from Management. The first of those is on the Greenline Quarterly Report. Would Councillors like a presentation in relation to this item?  No. All right. Well, can I please request of our Government's team that they please put a motion up on the screen. That is the motion. I'm going to move that. I'm looking for a seconder. Thank you, Councillor Camillo. I'll now speak to the item. The report before us tonight is a regular process update on the Greenline Project program of works over the last quarter. I do note we debated the Greenline at great length at last week's FMC meeting so I don't propose to add much further this evening, other than to report on the facts in this report and that is that as at the 31st of March 2025, total expenditure of Greenline stands at 27 million with 3.9 million being spent over this financial year to date. There has been significant activity at Birrarung Marr since we received final authority consents in December 2024 and it is good to see earthworks and activity occurring on that site, including piling, earthworks that will support all 150 metres of boardwalks along the river's edge. And we will very soon be seeing the completion of the Seafarers rest component which will be delivered by Riverlee in partnership with the City of Melbourne. That will be a further 3,500 square metres of park and a further 200 metres of boardwalk along the river. So much to look forward to in coming months and I thank officers and the team for this report. Over to you, Councillor Camillo. 

-:  Talking point. Hello. Can you hear?  Okay. So just to give some back foot, some of the points you're already raising here, Lord Mayor. So the partnership conversation are progressing with MAP Co, Riverland and private land owner and developers. We have a coordination underway with a range of private, including Lendlease to deliver the ambition of the Greenline project through the completion of private developments along there being such as the Calling Wharf and an agreement has been reached to VicTrack for a jointly funded developer. Feasibility study for the Banana Alley Vault in the waterfront area. This will be delivered in the coming months. And Council has put in an application from Federal funding through the UPPP Program that relates the funding to further partnership design focus around the Federation Wharf. Consultation is also underway with the Aboriginal - heritage Aboriginal groups to ensure that the culture of values are embedded with the Greenline Project towards - they can have some representation. Back to you, Lord Mayor. Thank you.  

-:  All right. Thank you for that, Councillor Camillo. Are there any other Councillors who wish to speak to this item?  No. In that case I put the matter to the vote. All those in favour, please raise your hands. I declare that carried unanimously. We now move on to agenda item 6.2 Queen Victoria Market Precinct Renewal Program Quarterly Report. Would Councillors like a report from officers in regards to this item?  I take that as a no. I'll therefore call on a Councillor to move a motion that is now being - appearing on the screen. Is there a mover for that motion?  That would be me given the infrastructure portfolio responsibility. I'm looking for a seconder. Thank you, Councillor Camillo. I will speak to this item. The report before us tonight is again a regular progress update, this time for the Queen Victoria Market Program and it covers the previous quarter. Since 2013 the total expenditure of the program stands at 178 million with 24 million being spent over this financial year to date. The major focus of our Market Renewal Team has been construction of the Trader Shed and works have progressed on the first of four basement levels and the team are forecasting that one level of the Trader Shed will be completed each month which is positive news. Other focuses over the period include restoration works for market buildings, as well as enhancements to the Queen Street public realm. Can I also thank Fahna for her lengthy submission to Council on this item tonight and thank her for all the work she does at the Queen Victoria Market, both as a trader and as also somebody who follows affairs of the market very closely. Councillor Camillo. 

-:  Please put your microphone on, Councillor Camillo.

-:  Sorry. Nothing to add, Lord Mayor. Thank you.  

-:  All right. In that case are there any other Councillors who wish to speak to this item?  In that case I put the matter to the vote. All those in favour, please raise your hand. I declare that carried unanimously. Welcome, Councillor Louey. All right. We now move on to agenda item 6.3 update to Council and Committee Meeting schedule. Do Councillors want a presentation in relation to this item?  No. In that case we'll move straight to the motion. A request that the motion please be put on the screen and looking for a mover for that motion. Could we have a mover, please?  

-:  Yes. Sorry, Lord Mayor. I'm happy to put this motion. 

-:  Thank you. As our finance and governance lead that's appropriate, Councillor Guest , and I'm happy to second it back to you, Councillor Guest. 

-:  I think this motion speaks for itself. It's moving our regular scheduled meeting forward by one day to bring it into the current financial year. I fully support this motion. It speaks for itself. 

-:  Thank you, Councillor Guest. I agree. I would just note for all those Town Hall aficionados who are tuned in tonight, that one of the changed meetings will be that we will have a Council meeting on the 30th of June, which is a Monday, not a Tuesday. So please update your calendars accordingly. Would any other Councillors like to speak to this item?  Councillor Dr Ball. 

-:  I do. Just to clarify that this is not moving the meeting from the 1stof July to the 30th of June, it's in fact moving the meeting from the 24th of June. To the 30th of June there will still be another meeting the following night on the 1st of July and the motion should probably be numbered one. 

-:  Where's the amendment you're seeking there?  

-:  I'm not seeking an amendment. I was just clarifying what the mover suggested, which was to imply that there might not be a meeting on the 1st of July and that is not correct. There will be a meeting on the 1st of July and the night before. 

-:  Apologies, Councillor Ball is correct. 

-:  All right. Thank you for that clarification. Are there any other Councillors who wish to speak for or against the motion? No. In that case I'll put the motion to the vote. All those in favour, please raise your hands. I declare that carried unanimously. All right. We move on to agenda item 6.4 upcoming travel. And I ask if Councillors would like a presentation in relation to this item or do any Councillors need to declare a conflict. Councillor Dr Olivia Ball.  

-:  Before any presentation since I am the subject of this motion and potentially would benefit materially from travel I will declare myself a conflict. 

-:  Thank you, Councillor Ball. And Councillor Camillo. 

-:  Yeah. I would like to declare a general conflict of interest in this matter. I know I'm going to be doing a trip and funding my own trip but it is important because some stuff can be involved with the dealings and contact with it obviously so maybe just it can be interpreted as a conflict so thank you. 

-:  Out of an abundance of caution. Okay. Thanks, Councillor Camillo. All right. Would Councillors like a presentation in relation to this item?  No. In that case I would look to a Councillor to move the motion which is going to be put on the screen. There it is. Thank you, Councillor Dr Guest. Is there a seconder for this motion?  Thank you, Councillor Rowse. Back to you, Councillor Dr Guest. 

-:  Thank you, Lord Mayor. Yes. I happily put forward these, in effect, what I call two motions for travel. I would just make a comment that Dr Olivia Ball will be the third person attending that trip. So in the interests of looking and examining all expenditure as we go forward I think the expenditure of three Councillors we should, of course, look to see what the return is afterwards. With that said I'm sure there will be a return. For the second item that is Councillor Rafael Camillo. I think he deserves praise as no-one could be seen to be more zealous and keen on keeping our city both safe and clean. That he will fund his own trip to see how it's done in Los Angeles and San Francisco is to be commended and that he will agree to producing a report for us within 60 days. He is a champion when it comes to safety and cleanliness of Melbourne. So, yes, happy to support this motion, Lord Mayor, and I hope good outcomes come for us all. 

-:  Thank you. Councillor Rowse. 

-:  Thank you, Lord Mayor. I happily support the motion on the screen and look forward to Councillor Dr Olivia Ball joining myself in Canberra for the ALGA Conference. She, of course, represented the City of Melbourne recently at the MAV Conference and got some phenomenal results for the City of Melbourne and I look forward to working with her up in Canberra to achieve similar things again. Thank you. 

-:  Look, I'll also speak in favour of this motion, having attended the ALGA Conference in Canberra several times before representing the City of Melbourne. It's very common for three Councillors to go. It's the biggest Local Government Conference in the country and it's the best opportunity you get to get connection to decision-makers in Canberra, both at a political level and also in the Commonwealth Government, and a great opportunity to connect with other Local Governments across country, hear the latest in thinking and new programs. There's also a very strong industry presence as well, where you can meet with a lot of companies that provide services to Councils and see who is providing superior services that can obviously be all to the good of the community we serve. So for all those reasons I think it's terrific that Councillor Ball is joining us and just picking up your point, Councillor Rowse, I was indeed at the recent MAV State Council meeting with Councillor Olivia Ball and saw another side to her as she indeed made her way busily around that Conference as votes were approaching on important matters of policy for Local Government and so I hope to see that energy and verve when we're in Canberra in the middle of the year. As for Councillor Camillo, terrific that he is travelling overseas on what is a private trip but is going to try and do a couple of work-related meetings while he is there and this support from us tonight allows that he can say that he's there in an official capacity for those meetings, and made all the way better by the fact that he's covering the cost of the whole thing himself. So very, very happy to be supporting that. Any other Councillors like to speak for or against this motion?  No. In that case all those in favour, please raise your hands. I declare that carried unanimously. Please invite Councillors Ball and Camillo to rejoin us. We now move on to agenda item 7, general business. There are no items of general business. Urgent business before us, are there any items of urgent business?  I don't believe that there are. So we will now move to closure of the open meeting. I will be looking for a Councillor to move the motion bringing the meeting to a close. Thank you, Councillor Scott. Is there a seconder for that?  Thank you, Councillor Liu and I will now put that to the vote. All those in favour please raise your hand. I declare that motion carried and I therefore wish to thank members of the public for their interest and attendance and declare the open meeting closed to the public at 5.48 p.m. Thank you one and all for attending.
